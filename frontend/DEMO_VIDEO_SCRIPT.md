> - **Roads / Potholes**: Real photographs of asphalt craters and road settling along West High Court (WHC) Road, Great Nag Road, or Medical Square junction.  
> - **Proof of Work**: Authentic municipal before/after road resurfacing and cold-mix asphalt compaction photos executed by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) field crews.  
> - **Solid Waste**: Real community dustbin sites near Cotton Market or Sitabuldi.  
> - **Water / Drainage**: Real pipeline repair excavation photos from Dharampeth.
